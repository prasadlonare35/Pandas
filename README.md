# Pandas Learning 📊  

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic to intermediate concepts of **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation.  

## 📖 About Pandas  
Pandas is a widely used library for handling structured data efficiently. It provides powerful tools for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using DataFrames and Series.  

## ✨ Key Features:  
- Efficient handling of structured data using DataFrames & Series.  
- Built-in functions for data filtering, grouping, and aggregation.  
- Support for reading/writing various file formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.).  
- Missing data handling and transformation operations.  
- Integration with other data science libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.  

## 📚 What's Inside?  

### 1️⃣ `PandasSeries.py`  
- Introduction to Pandas Series  
- Creating a Series with default and custom indexes  

### 2️⃣ `PandasDataFrame.py`  
- Creating DataFrames from dictionaries and lists  
- Exploring, filtering, and modifying data  
- Handling missing values  
- Sorting, grouping, and merging DataFrames  
- Working with time-series data  

### 3️⃣ `LoadingAndSavingData.py`  
- Reading data from CSV files  
- Modifying and saving data back to CSV  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasadlonare35/Pandas.git
   cd Pandas
2. Run any of the Python scripts:
    ```bash
